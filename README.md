Inferno Autocomplete
==================

Accessible, extensible, Autocomplete for Inferno.js.


Docs coming soon, but for now here are some [examples](https://reactcommunity.org/react-autocomplete/) :)

Trying to settle on the right API, and then focus hard on accessibility,
there are a few missing bits right now.

Stuff we need help with:

- mobile support verification generally
- default mobile styles/positioning (you'll notice the styles are
  pretty lean, on purpose, apps should style this however they'd like)
- tests (eventually)

# Tests!

TBD
